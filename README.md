# ErgoAlert - Ergonomic Risk Analysis using RULA Score

## Course Project for Ergonomics/Human factors for Design

### Features

**1. Real-Time RULA Score Calculation and Monitoring**
- Calculate RULA (Rapid Upper Limb Assessment) score in real-time.
- Enable risk sound alerts to monitor posture over an extended period.
- Check risk level duration.

**2. RULA Score Calculation via Image Upload**
- Upload an image to calculate the RULA level score.
- Utilize the risk guidelines to perform further inspections based on the score obtained from the image analysis.

### General Guidelines

This section provides advice on maintaining proper posture and ergonomics while working. It includes:
- Yoga postures are recommended for practice during breaks.
- General seating and posture guidelines to minimize ergonomic risk.

### Future Scope

- **Personalized Ergonomic Solutions**: Use the data to personalize a chair, test and analyze it, tailoring it to individual needs for optimal ergonomic support. This could be applied to any sitting-related posture item to enhance comfort and reduce ergonomic risks.

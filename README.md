# Ergonomic-Risk-Analysis using RULA score
 ## Course Project for Ergonomic Factors Affecting Design
 - Feature 1 - Calculate your RULA Score in real-time, and then get alerts by allowing the risk sound ON
 - Feature 2 -  Calculate the RULA Level Scor by uploading an Image
 - By calculating the scores for the image one can use the risk guidelines, to analyse further inspection over the score
 - General Guidelines of the page discusses some "advised" yoga-postures to take in between the brakes, while working and it also has some general seating and posture guidelines
## Future Scope
- This can be used to calculate an average score of real time seating and then suggest changes in either the chair or the posture part which is significantly giving such high alerting scores.
- These can be used to personalise a chair and test and analyse them , on a personal product like chair/any sitting-related posture item.
